  ## Description
  
  A web application that allows a user to track PMS and menstrual cycle based on a calendar and journal entries. The user can track general mood, time of cycle and make notes for how they feel that day. A user can save journal entries, update and delete them. The app was made to help people who have menstrual cycles better understand their emotions and make decisions based on if emotions are intellectual or hormonal.
